Title: WEIRD RACE GAME

About: This is a web game written in HTML5, CSS and pure Javascripts, it's a fun project I started off my first HTML5 games turorial on W3schools, I can't tell what I'm expecting the finished version of the game to look like for now but I sure will be adding new features every now and then.

Some of the features I'm currently working on:
1: Make opponents avoid obstacles on their own.
2: Add the opponents animation function in opponents[i] object.
